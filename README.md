This is currently implemented till point 3.  This will calculate parcel cost based on size and weight

Adding new parcel type for Heavy parcel. Current implementation will provide ability to add extra parcel types without touching/modifying existing code

Discount implementation - Probably implement a grouping based on parcel type so it can be used to recognise discount
